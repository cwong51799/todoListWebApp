This was a class project that I had which made use of React, Redux, and Firebase. Some of the code was provided by my professor to provide groundwork.


To check it out:

1. Download the repository
2. Open the folder in a terminal and put in "npm i" to install the packages.
3. Once this is done, run "npm start".


Also, I want to publish this onto my Github pages. Note to self: find out how to do that.
